# Back in the good old days, you used to be able to write a darn near
# uncrackable code by simply taking each letter of a message and incrementing it
# by a fixed number, so "abc" by 2 would look like "cde", wrapping around back
# to "a" when you pass "z".  Write a function, `caesar_cipher(str, shift)` which
# will take a message and an increment amount and outputs the encoded message.
# Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.
#
# To get an array of letters "a" to "z", you may use `("a".."z").to_a`. To find
# the position of a letter in the array, you may use `Array#find_index`.

# jumble_sort("hello", ['o', 'l', 'h', 'e']) => 'ollhe'
