# Durak

Durak is a card game that is popular in Russia and other post-Soviet states. The word durak (дурак) means *fool* or *idiot*.

## Coding Hints

* This skeleton project was made to resemble the a/A practice assessment 2, Blackjack.
* For solutions, see this GitHub repo: https://github.com/AustinWood/durak
* I welcome comments and pull requests if you think that any of your solutions are better / more elegant than mine :)
* As the logic for this game is slightly more complicated than the Blackjack practice assessment, I left a few methods in place so that it shouldn't take ridiculously long to pass all the specs.
* It is suggested that you run the specs in the following order:

```
bundle exec rspec spec/deck_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/player_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/game_spec.rb
```

## Game Rules

* Start with a shuffled deck of 36 cards.
* Play with 2-5 players.
* The goal is to get rid of all your cards. The last player with cards is the 'durak' (fool).
* Each player is dealt six cards. The remaining cards are placed in the center and form the 'talon'.
* The bottom-most card in the talon determines the trump suit.
* Ace is the highest rank and six is the lowest. Trumps always beat non-trump cards regardless of rank (e.g., a trump six beats a non-trump ace).
* The player with the lowest-value card matching the trump suit is the first attacker.
* Each turn:
    1. The attacker chooses one card to place face-up on the table
    2. The defender (the player to the attacker's left) must defend with either a card of higher value and of the same suit, or a card of any value matching the trump suit. If the attacker played a trump card, then the defender must match the suit and beat the value.
    3. Most variations of the game allow the other players to launch further attacks on the defender after the defender has played a defending card. This rule has been omitted to simplify game logic.
    4. If the defender was unable to defend, he takes the attacking card and adds it to his hand. If the defender was able to successfully defend, then both the attacking and defending cards are discarded and not used throughout the remainder of the game.
    5. All players, starting with the attacker, followed by the defender, pickup cards from the talon so that they have 6 cards in their hand. This step only applies until the talon has been exhausted. Cards are never drawn from the discard pile.
    6. If the defender was successful, they become the next attacker. If the defender failed, then they lose their chance to attack and the player to their left becomes the next attacker.
* The game continues until only one player is left with any cards. In rare cases, the final two players may get rid of their last card at the same time, in which case there is no loser.
* The durak becomes the dealer for the next game. The dealer asks the person to his left to cut the deck. The player may opt not to cut the deck and jokingly insult the previous round's loser by saying "Nye snimayu shapkee Doo-rah-kam" ("I do not tip my hat to fools"). The dealer must go around the table asking for people to cut the deck. If all refuse, the dealer cuts the deck himself.
